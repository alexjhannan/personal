    I was looking for a reference tool that mapped out
    notes on a guitar fretboard in a given scale. I couldn't find one
    online that fit what I wanted â€” so I built one.
    This tool is coded with hand-written SVGs
    that are fully responsive across all viewports.
    I also had a bit of fun adding a radial menu button
    to handle the two-tier UI interaction of selecting a scale and a key.`,
